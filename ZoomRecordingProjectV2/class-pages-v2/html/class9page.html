      <h2>Descpription</h2>
      <p>Class Description/Overview: In this class we go over making Forms in html. We learn about the Label tag and the Input tag. we also review responsive design from the previous class. We also Cover Semantic HTML:<br/>Examples of non-semantic elements are: &ltdiv&gt and &ltspan&gt, The Problem with these is that E-readers and Search Engines dont know what content is inside them. <br/> Examples of semantic elements are: &ltnav&gt, &ltform&gt, and &ltarticle&gt these can be used in place of these non-semantic elements and will help with search engine optimization(not really sure what that means yet) also E-readers to understand where the content is within them. <br/> The professor also said that when getting interviewed for a job you might get asked if you know Semantic html. which is very buzzwordy for such a simple thing just like Responsive Design. ____________.</p>
